[Docker] is not just for containerization of web services, Although containerization of web services is becoming one of the biggest advances to hit DevOps since Linux it's really far more than that. I am starting to use [Docker] more often for simple dependency management (well, more like dependency containment) and process management (well, management through containment).

Setting up a few small blogs for myself, friends and projects I work on, I am not really a front end developer and so keeping up on all the sass / ES6 and tooling that goes into building decent websites is far too much effort for me. I need to get back to writing software.

git clone git@github.com:barryclark/jekyll-now.git example
