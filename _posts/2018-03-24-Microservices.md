The following is a collection of articles on [Microservices]. The [Microservices] architecture is a variant of the 
[service-oriented architecture] (SOA), a collection of loosely coupled services.

#### Key Goals of Microservices
- Rapid development
- Continuous deployment

#### Best Practices
- [Version Control](https://12factor.net/codebase) - All code and **configuration** should be versioned.
- [Log to Standard Out](https://12factor.net/logs) - This unifies the log collection process.
- [Package Dependencies](https://12factor.net/dependencies) - Ensure the stability of the build process.

#### Twelve-Factor Principles
- Portable - Service (container) should be able to be run anywhere.
- Continually Deployable - Able to deploy any time without disruption.
- Scalable - Multiple copies should be able to run concurrently (stateless)
