The following is a collection of articles on [Microservices]. The [Microservices] architecture is a variant of the 
[service-oriented architecture] (SOA), a collection of loosely coupled services.

#### Key Goals of Microservices
- Rapid development
- Continuous deployment

#### Best Practices
- [Version Control](https://12factor.net/codebase) - All code and **configuration** should be versioned.
- [Log to Standard Out](https://12factor.net/logs) - This unifies the log collection process.
- [Package Dependencies](https://12factor.net/dependencies) - Ensure the stability of the build process.

#### Twelve-Factor Principles
- Portable - Service (container) should be able to be run anywhere.
- Continually Deployable - Able to deploy any time without disruption.
- Scalable - Multiple copies should be able to run concurrently (stateless)

#### JSON Web Tokens (JWT) - Client -> Server trust.
- Compact, self contained method for transferring secure data as a JSON object.
- Use for Authentication and Information Exchange
- See [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/)
- Server creates a token, client uses token to make requests.

#### Containers - Docker
- Docker is simply an API on top of existing process isolation technology.
- Independent packages
- Namespace Isolation

#### Alpine Linux
[Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) **Small. Simple. Secure.** Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox.
