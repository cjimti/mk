[Helm] is the official [Kubernetes] package manager. Helm is one of the preferred methods of continuous deployment of containers on a Kubernettes and consists of the command line tool `helm` and it's counterpart Tiller, running on the cluster.

I use [Minikube] to play with and test helm on my mac laptop. [Minikube] is a great way to learn and experiment with [Kubernetes] without disrupting a production cluster, or having to setup a custom cluster in your datacenter or in the cloud. There is a nice [demo of multi node minikube](https://asciinema.org/a/162127) setup if you need to test on more than one node.

A [Helm] chart is a directoy with a collection of [Kubernetes] config files. Create a new [Helm] chart directory with templates run:

`helm create example`

You get a directory structure starting with the name you specified in create: 

```plain
   |-example
   |---charts
   |---templates
```
