I have been writing software professionally for over 20 years now. I started as a kid with [BASIC]  on a neat little [TRS-80] Model 4p (well actually it was huge by today's standards). GOTO 40

I am a full stack software and systems architect based in Los Angeles, California. This site is a just a place for me to store some notes and thoughts about some of the work I do, well less about my work and more about my hobby, which is exploring technologies that interest me. I am most at home in greenfield development, but my day job does keep me grounded in the realities of legacy systems. Of course, we live in a day when legacy means a technology or programming language more than a couple years old.

A few of my current interests:

Wish I still had my old TRS-80. But thanks to Wikipedia I can still look at one!
