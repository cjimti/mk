I have been writing software professionaly for over 20 years now. I started as a kid with BASIC  on a cool little TRS-80 Model 4p (well actually it was huge by todays standards). GOTO 40

I am a full stack software and systems architect based in Los Angeles, California. This site is a just a place for me to store some notes and thoughts about some of the work I do, well less about my work and really my hobby, wich is exploring technologies that interest me. I am most at home in greed field development, but my day job does keep me grounded in the realities of legacy systems. Of course we live in a day when legacy means a technology or programming language more than a couple years old.

A few of my current interests:

- [Microservices] - [Articles](/tag/microservices/)
- [Serverless]
- [Docker] - [Articles](/tag/docker/)
- [Kubernettes] - [Articles](/tag/kubernetes/)
- [Helm]
- [Golang]
- [Rust]
- [Apache Kafka]
- [Apache Cassandra] - [Articles](/tag/cassandra/)
- [ELK]
- [Armbian]
- [Orange Pi]
- [Libre Computer]

- [intermezzOS]
- [Github] - [Articles](/tag/github/)
- [Github Pages] - [Articles](/tag/github-pages/)
- [Jekyll] - [Articles](/tag/jekyll/)

Wish I still had my old TRS-80. But thanks to Wikipedia I can still look at one!
